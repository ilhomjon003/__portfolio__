              Hi! My name is Ilhomjon. I was born in 31 October, 2003. I've learned a web development for more a year and worked in this field. Now, I am a Junior Web Developer who is really into making delightful and top-notch websites. I finished my course at Algorithm with certification.

              <p>
              In a year, I have learnt <b>HTML5</b> <b>CSS</b>  <b>Sass</b> <b>Javascript</b> <b>ReactJS</b> <b>NodeJS</b> and so on.
              </p>
              <p>
              But, I am still learning to be professional in web development while working.
              I am not selfish, but I hate speaking too much.
            </p>
